GAME TWISTS:
=============

* Unlocking of modes - after players get to a new highscore, unlock the next mode
	* [DONE] Add lock images at the popup view to show user what modes they have unlocked

	* [X] Wait! 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. // pretty stupid actually 
	* [X] Shake! // this would make game play not repetitive and pretty difficult - user should only have to swipe to select 
	* [X] Upside down! // pretty stupid 

	* [DONE] Reverse! 
		* [DONE] Add an icon=
	* [DONE] Reverse mode
	* [DONE] Shades mode
	* [DONE] Smaller circles mode
	* [DONE] Circle question mode (replace number question string with # circles with specified color in the question)
	* +1, -1 mode
	* B&W mode (everything is black and white)


ANIMATIONS:
===========

* Better indication of score; maybe some type of rolling characters?
* [DONE] highlight correct answers on lose event
* [DONE] change border color of gameview on swipe left and swipe right


GOAL TO ACHIEVE:
=================

* "How good are your eyes?"
* Just use shades and lower the shading each time a round is won to see how far a player can get to


TUTORIAL:
=========

* Better way to learn how to play: maybe go through a walk through?
* Set a flag that is saved on the iphone to see if the user has played or not before
* if the user has not played before, give the user 10 seconds a round
* Popup: "Swipe left to reject the card. Swipe right to accept the card. Reject the card until you find five blue dots as indicated by the title."
* Popup: "Swipe right now!"
* Popup: "Notice the timer will change colors from green, yellow and red to indicate how much time is left"
* Popup: "Achieve highscores to unlock new levels!"


LEVELS:
==========

* User should be given more time to play at first - so that they can learn
* Decrease time afterwards
* [DONE] Levels are cool
* Better animations to show what's going on
* Sound effects

GAME PLAY:
============

* [DONE] Make it so the user swipes less to register an accept/reject event
* Better animations when card is swiped and not swiped

BUGS:
=====

* user can still release the card after pop up displays
* there seem sto be some out of range exceptions? happens with big numbers on the card
* [DONE] on match, game twist message doens't display 
	-> probably becuase the match! message is overriding it 
* User should not be able to interact with the game view once the round is over
