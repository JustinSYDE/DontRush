# DontRush
A simple toilet game to get you thinking before you swipe right

###Inspiration
---------------

Have you ever accidentally swiped right on somebody on Tinder? Or regretfully swiped left?
This often happened to my colleagues so I thought I'd make a game out of it to train our minds to be careful when we're swiping.
Look twice swipe once.
